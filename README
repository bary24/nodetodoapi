This repository contains the Backend skeleton of a simple Todo list app that enables the developer to use the CRUD operations 
and can be used with a frontend framework like angular or React 


You should create a file named config.json in the config directory and write your custom username and password
to be used by the index.js when retreiving data from the database 

The structure of config.json should be like this :
{uname:<your username>,
pw:<your password>}
